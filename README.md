# Park Protection

Website: [parkprotection.me](https://parkprotection.me/)

Project created to inform the public of the endangered plants and animals of the United States and in which national parks they may be protected in. This web application was built with React.js, SQL for the database, and Python's Flask for the backend. There were many other libraries and APIs used in this project, such as bootstrap for React, Google's Google Map API, the National Park Service's API and more.

The project was developed by me, Ameya Joshi, Skylore Evans, Jordan Bogaards, and Pedro Silva.
